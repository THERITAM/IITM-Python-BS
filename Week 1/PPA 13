The following expression is called a continued fraction:

x + ( 1 / ( x + 1 / ( x + 1 / (x + 1 / ( x + 1 / x ))))))


Accept a positive integer x as input, compute the value of this continued fraction and store the result in a variable named cfrac. We will round off your answer to exactly two decimal places. 
You don't have to print the output to the console, we will take care of that.

:Code:

x=int(input())
cfrac=str(x+(1/(x+1/(x+1/(x+1/(x+1/x))))))
y=cfrac[0:4]
print(y)
